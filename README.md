On Firefox or Chrome and maybe other, you can extract all urls' tabs by a using a "hidden" functionnality.

But you have no time to click on each tab and get all GIF URLs. 

That's why this script is made for you !

Go on 'options' menu then 'home'. First option allows you to select currents urls as home pages. If you click on current pages,
your sweet browser will give you a string with all URLs separated by a pipe.

You just need to copy-paste this string into the script for urls variable, and execute the script with python, and that's it !
